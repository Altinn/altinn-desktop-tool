# **Important Update: Transition from WPF Toolkit to Web Application**

We are excited to announce that the WPF Client, previously utilized by Altinn Support, is transitioning to a new, modern web application. 

### New Repository
The WPF Toolkit repository is now archived. The new repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-support-dashboard) 

### What This Means for You
The transition marks the end of maintenance for the old WPF Toolkit, as we move towards a more secure and interactive platform. This upgrade is part of our ongoing efforts to enhance user experience and ensure the highest level of security. 

### Have Questions?
We're here to help. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to reach out to [Espen E. Halsen](mailto:espen.elstad.halsen@digdir.no?subject=[Altinn-WPF-Archived]). We appreciate your cooperation and understanding during this transition phase.
